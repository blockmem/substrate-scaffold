# Substrate Scaffold

# Deliverable
A command line script that allows even an unexperienced user to run an EC2 instance with a Dockchain node in it.

# Parts
- Infra script to create and manage instances
- Install script that downloads and installs the dockchain binary in a running machine
- Binary for Ubuntu 18.04

# Why 
By compiling the binary ourselves we allow the user to have a better experience. The downside is that we need to compile for all the platforms we want to support. Luckily for now we only plan to support Ubuntu 18.04.
